                Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish 
                with cooking spray.

                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add ground beef, 
                and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up meat into smaller
                 pieces with a wooden spoon, until almost fully browned, about 4 
                 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper, and cook over medium-high, 
                 stirring occasionally, until softened and tender, 6 to 8 minutes.

                Stir in tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste
                 has slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Stir in beef broth,
                  using a spatula to scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir 
                  in ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, garlic powder, and 
                  black pepper until fully combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high, 
                  and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and bubbles 
                  appear all over the surface, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat, and 
                  transfer to the prepared baking dish.

                Whisk together corn muffin mix, milk, baking powder, and eggs in a medium 
                bowl until fully combined; spoon in an even layer over sloppy Joe filling.

                Bake in the preheated oven until cornbread is golden brown and a wooden pick 
                inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
